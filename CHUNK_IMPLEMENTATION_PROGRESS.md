#### Implementation Plan
```
Enhanced Menu After Chunk 2:
🐹 Today: 1,247 tokens • $2.34 📈 (+12%)
📊 This Week: 8,923 tokens • $15.67 📉 (-3%)
📅 This Month: 24,567 tokens • $45.23 ━ (0%)
─────────────────────────────
▶ By Provider
  🤖 Anthropic: 45% (563 tokens • $1.05)
  🔥 OpenAI: 35% (437 tokens • $0.89)
  🔍 Google AI: 20% (247 tokens • $0.40)
  Total Cost: $2.34
▶ Recent Activity  
  Last hour: 23 tokens • $0.04
  Peak cost/hr: $0.28
  Avg cost/hr: $0.12
```

#### Files to Create/Modify
- **New**: `Sources/Ham/CostCalculator.swift` - Core cost calculation engine
- **New**: `Sources/Ham/PricingData.swift` - API model pricing database
- **Modify**: `Sources/Ham/UsageAnalytics.swift` - Add cost fields to analytics

## 🏗️ Implementation Guidelines

### Session Management
- **One chunk per session** to manage 200K context window
- **Complete testing** before moving to next chunk
- **Document progress** in this file after each session
- **Maintain backwards compatibility** with all existing features

### Development Workflow
```bash
# Standard chunk implementation process:
1. Review chunk plan and objectives
2. Implement core functionality
3. Update existing integrations  
4. Test thoroughly
