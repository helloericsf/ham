# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Current State

This is an empty directory ready for project development. No technology stack has been chosen yet.

## Development Approach

### Requirements First
- Always clarify project requirements before suggesting technology choices
- Understand the problem domain and constraints before architecture decisions
- Ask about target users, performance needs, deployment requirements, and team preferences

### Project Initialization Process
1. **Requirements Gathering**: Define what the project should accomplish
2. **Constraints Analysis**: Understand limitations (budget, time, team skills, deployment)
3. **Technology Selection**: Choose stack based on requirements, not preferences
4. **Architecture Planning**: Design high-level structure
5. **Implementation**: Build iteratively with feedback

### When Working in This Directory
- Start by understanding the specific requirements and use case
- Consider factors like:
  - Target audience (web users, CLI users, developers, etc.)
  - Performance requirements
  - Scalability needs
  - Deployment environment
  - Team technical expertise
  - Maintenance requirements

### Next Steps
Once requirements are defined, this file should be updated with:
- Chosen technology stack and rationale
- Specific development commands
- Project architecture overview
- Key design decisions and constraints
